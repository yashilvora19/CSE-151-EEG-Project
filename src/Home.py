    One of the leading causes of non natural death is road accidents. There may be several contributing factors that 
    lead to vehicle casualties, including traffic, weather, road conditions etc. We wanted to predict the severity 
    of road accidents ranging from Slight, Serious, to Fatal using supervised models such as Logistic Regression, 
    Decision Trees etc. Attributes that may be used to predict the data include the road conditions, the weather 
    conditions, vehicle types, or what kind of area theyâ€™re in.

    Our data is mainly focused on locations in the UK, so while it may not necessarily apply similarly in the US, we could still use this model to run on US datasets and see the results. It is a dataset with 14 columns and over 600k observations, with columns including severity of accident, the date, number of casualties, longitude/ latitude, road surface conditions, road types, urban/ rural areas, weather conditions, and vehicle types. Ethical concerns include if our stakeholders were vehicle companies, would they have reduced sales if, say, trucks were more likely to lead to severe accidents? However, by figuring out what would predict the severity of road accidents, we can also prevent harm by noting the features that largely impact the severity.
